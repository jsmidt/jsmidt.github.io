# Solving the Two Sum Problem in Python

I wanted to test a workflow for writing GitHub Pages blog posts where I solve a problem in a Jupyter notebook and turn it into a blog post. For this test, I chose the "Two Sum" problem from LeetCode. Let's dive in.

---

## Problem Description

Here's the problem as stated on LeetCode:

> Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.
>
> You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
>
> You can return the answer in any order.

### Example Input/Output

**Example 1:**

- Input: `nums = [2,7,11,15]`, `target = 9`
- Output: `[0,1]`
- Explanation: Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.

## My Initial Approach

My first thought was to brute-force it. Loop over each pair of indices `(i, j)` in the list and check if the corresponding elements add up to the target. I also need to ensure `i` and `j` aren't the same index. Here's the code:

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
        lenn = len(nums)
        for i in range(0, lenn):
            for j in range(i + 1, lenn):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j:
                    return [i, j]

nums = [2,7,11,15]
target = 9

sol = Solution()
sol.twoSum(nums, target)
```

Result: [0, 1]. Success!

I tested it with other examples, and it worked for those too. But as you’d expect, this brute-force approach is slow (O(n^2) complexity), so I started looking for ways to optimize.

## Optimization Attempt

I realized there’s no need to loop over every index in the second loop. After checking all j indices for a given i, there’s no reason to check j = 0 again. Also, the i != j condition is unnecessary since the nested loop already avoids this scenario.

Here’s the updated code:

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
        lenn = len(nums)
        for i in range(0, lenn):
            for j in range(i + 1, lenn):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i, j]

nums = [2,7,11,15]
target = 9

sol = Solution()
sol.twoSum(nums, target)
```

Result: [0, 1]. Same result, but it’s twice as fast.  

##  The O(n) Problem

Some people were getting another factor of 10 times faster so I knew I probably needed an O(n) solution. After some trial and error, I gave in and looked up the answer.

Turns out, the optimal solution uses a hash table (or dictionary in Python). With a hash table, you can store the difference between the target and the current number as a key and look up indices in constant time. This is elegant and efficient. But since I didn’t arrive at this on my own, I’ll stick with my O(n^2) solution for now.

## Final Thoughts

The brute-force solution works, and the optimized version is better, even if it’s still O(n^2). If you’re diving into LeetCode problems, don’t be afraid to start with something simple and work your way up. Sometimes, brute force is enough to get the job done—and it’s a great way to learn.

Hope you enjoyed this glimpse into my thought process!
